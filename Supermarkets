We propose developing a mobile app for supermarkets that enables customers to conveniently order groceries online
and pick them up at the store. The app will feature a user-friendly interface where customers can browse products,
add items to their cart, and select a preferred pickup time. It will also include real-time inventory updates,
payment options, and notifications when orders are ready. This app will streamline the shopping experience, reduce in-store crowding,
and offer customers a quick and efficient way to get their groceries without the need for home delivery.

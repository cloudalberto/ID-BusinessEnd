We propose developing a schedule app and website tailored for barbershops to streamline appointment booking and improve customer experience. 
The app will allow clients to view available time slots, book appointments, receive reminders, and manage their bookings effortlessly. Meanwhile,
the website will showcase services, stylist profiles, and pricing, while also integrating the scheduling system for seamless online booking.
Both platforms will be mobile-friendly, ensuring ease of use for both customers and staff, ultimately reducing no-shows and optimizing the barbershop's daily operations.
